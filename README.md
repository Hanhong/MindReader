==========
This program contains two “mind read” games which is presented by a GUI. 
The rule for the first game is that the user chooses a number randomly from 10 to 99, adds the two digits together, and subtracts the sum from the original number. My program will provide a chart with all the numbers from 0 to 99 and their relevant symbols. The user will find the relevant symbol to his/her final number, click “continue” button, and then my program will show the symbol he/she chooses. 
The rule for the second game is that the user chooses one symbol from the sixteen symbols presented on the right of the screen. My program will show the user’s choice after five yes or no questions.
